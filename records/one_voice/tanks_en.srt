00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,476
Here, in the east, the equipment does not last long because of the fighting.

2
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:06,801
It often needs major repairs and new parts.

3
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:13,792
Masters of the 80th Brigade's repair company restore both damaged armored vehicles and weapons to life.

4
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:15,375
This is a section of the repair company.

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,378
What are your duties?

6
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:23,507
Restoration, repair of weapons equipment, which is on...

7
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:25,750
on the register of the military unit.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,336
What is the most common range of tasks you perform here?

9
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:31,237
What kind of equipment?

10
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,079
Or all the equipment in general?

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,519
All the equipment. Various.

12
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:40,890
Starts with cars provided by volunteers, units, battalions.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,757
He closes it all with tanks.

14
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:50,061
And what's the most difficult stage?

15
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:51,283
Weapons.

16
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:53,505
There is an experienced gunsmith in Remroth.

17
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:58,790
Vitaliy is proficient with various calibers, from pistols to large-caliber machine guns.

18
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:02,154
Neighboring brigades bring their weapons to us for repair.

19
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:06,658
They have no gunsmiths who have repaired weapons for anyone.

20
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:09,581
Here, in this case, it's an MG-42.

21
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:19,331
We collect MG-42s and MG-53s from Lihoslav, which we also have in our household.

22
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,832
We are currently under repair.

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:32,320
To cut out a complicated part for a foreign grenade launcher or weld the hull of a trophy APC, local craftsmen take on the most difficult orders from the front.

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,264
They say they can do anything.

25
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:52,540
Military television also made a small contribution to our victory.
